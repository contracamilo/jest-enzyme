This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What we do here
 . set up a very simple React App with Jest and Enzyme
 . Used Enzyme .shallow() function to render a component
 . Tested that required DOM  elements were rendered using .find()
 . Tested Enzyme using Enzyme setState() and State()
 . Used .simulate to interact with rendered elements (clicked button)
 . Tested the comp for updates after interaction
 . Create re-usable setup() and findByTestAttr() functions

## Challenge
. Create a decrement setup for the app () (the counter can{t go below zero) use alert}
. Create the unit test
